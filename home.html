								<p>The return of the iconic Air Jordan 4 Bred is almost here, as it’s dropping again in May to celebrate the AJ 4’s 30th anniversary. Also nicknamed the “Black Cements,” the shoe made its last retro in 2012 featuring a Jumpman logo on the heel. The last time it featured OG Nike Air branding was in 1999, and this 2019 retro sneaker will carry that same branding once more. Covered in the OG hues of “Black/Cement Grey-Summit White-Fire Red” across its nubuck upper with mesh, synthetic and leather accents, the style is completed with the Jumpman logo flight branding seen on the tongues.</p>
								<p>This release of the Air Jordan 4 Bred pays homage to its debut on the court with MJ in 1989 against Cleveland. The release celebrates its cool nature that made it an instant style staple both on and off the court.</p>

								<p>The Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG in Dark Mocha has finally received a confirmed release date from the Swoosh, and it’s scheduled for the second week of May, alongside complementary apparel. Donning an earthy color scheme of sail and dark mocha, the sneaker boasts a mixed construction of nubuck overlays and leather underlays. A highlight is the addition of a backwards Swoosh embroidered onto its lateral side, along with a Cactus Jack tongue badge and hidden velcro pocket around the ankle region. Other finishing details consist of red Nike Air branding tongue labels and debossed logos on the heels.</p>

								<p>After the huge success of the original Air Jordan 1 “Shattered Backboard”, it appears that Jordan Brand will be releasing a third variation later this Fall, right before Halloween. At the moment sources suggest that the model boasts a slightly different color layout across its crinkled glossy/patent leather construction with black dominating the majority of the upper. Starfish (orange) is implemented on the toebox, Swoosh, ankle/heel, and the Nike Air branding on the tongues. Finally, a Sail/Off-White rubber sole unit solidifies the design.</p>

								<p>What if I told you that the Air Jordan 1 High OG Bred release from 2016 was not as “OG” as we all thought it was? What if I told you that Jordan Brand is capable of releasing a Jordan 1 OG that’s even more identical to the original pair from 1985? The reason we bring all this up is because the latest rumor suggest that we will be getting yet another Air Jordan 1 High OG Bred release this holiday season and this time around the shoe is supposed to come with identical construction, dimensions and details as the OG pair from 1985. This means that we can expect a higher cut making it an even more true high top, a shape the resemble the 1985 even more, and a type of leather that mimics the one used on the 1985 pair. It goes without saying that the Air Jordan 1 High OG Bred 2019 will come with a Black and Red leather upper alongside a White midsole and Red rubber outsole.</p>

								<p>The Air Jordan 11 Bred 2019 is one of the most popular colorways ever to be produced on the iconic silhouette, and the sneaker’s OG styling is going to be returning for the holiday 2019 season. First worn by Michael Jordan during the 1996 NBA Playoffs, the sneaker helped him earn another championship and NBA Finals MVP. Images of the 2019 edition have not surfaced yet but the sneaker sports a mixture of Black, White, and Varsity Red. The shoe will feature the same original high-cut patent leather upper and it is still unconfirmed whether they will come with “45” or “23” on the heels.</p>

								<p>Jordan Brand frequently acknowledges Michael Jordan’s National Championship-winning days at the University of North Carolina with special Air Jordan colorways, and now they’re nodding to MJ’s collegiate feats yet again with a UNC-colored Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG. Following in the footsteps of a ladies-only “UNC Patent” makeup that released this February, these Air Jordan 1s offer a rich leather construction, are made in a men’s size run, and present a look that’s slightly more toned down then their bold patent-equipped predecessors. An elegant sail arrives on the quarter, throat, and toebox, while a dark obsidian blue is used on the eyestays, mudguard, forefoot overlays, midfoot Swoosh, ball-and-wings logo and collar. Signature Tar Heel powder blue is then called upon for the heel and collar flaps, completing the look. As arguably the most revered Jumpman retro silhouette on the market currently, these AJ1s are sure to be a hit when they release on August 17th, so check out a detailed set of images below while you wait, and stay tuned to our Jordan Release Dates page for info on other upcoming JB footwear.</p>

The Hall of Famer has been a member of Jordan Brand since 1997, and in 2002, Ray Allen sported two player exclusive Air Jordan 7s with “Home” and “Away” colorways during his tenure with the Milwaukee Bucks. To celebrate his special career and 2018 Hall of Fame induction, Jordan Brand will be releasing an Air Jordan 7 Ray Allen this year. Featuring a blacked-out nubuck upper, grey and purple accents are seen on the midsole, followed by a purple Jumpman logo on the ankle and green outsole to mimic the Bucks Home theme, to top off the design.</p>

								<p>Fans of the Air Jordan 10 Seattle Supersonics will be happy to hear that there is a rumor going around that Jordan Brand will be bringing back this release later on this Fall season.The Air Jordan 10 Seattle Supersonics made its debut as part of the “City Pack” back in 1995. Paying home to the city of Seattle and the Seattle SuperSonics (now known as the Oklahoma City Thunder), the shoe comes dressed in a White, Black, Kelly Green, and Yellow Gold color scheme. Design details on the shoe include the White leather upper, Black detailing and the Green and Gold accents to help represent the team colors of the SuperSonics. Although nothing is sent in stone just yet, the Air Jordan 10 Seattle Supersonics is expected to release on October 19th for the retail price of $190. FYI, the images you see on here are not the 2019, they are of the Jordan 10 City Pack from 1995.</p>
